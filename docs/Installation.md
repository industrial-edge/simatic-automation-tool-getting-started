## Configure Device Layer 2 Access
The device scanner requires layer 2 access to be able to scan the network for devices.

You can configure the layer 2 access either during the onboarding of the device through the management or later on directly on the Industrial Edge Device.

### During Onboarding

2. Configure your device and click on "Next" to get to the network settings.

3. Click on the "+" button at the top right to configure the network interface.
